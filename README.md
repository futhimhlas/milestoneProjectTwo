# Milestone Project Two: Premier League Soccer Directory (Interactive)
In this project, I aim to consume an API to provide interactive and easily digestable information on the current 20 English Premier league football teams using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and javascript/jQuery.
By using javascript, users will be able to manipulate the site to access information on their favourite teams (and certain players on those teams). Parts of this information will also be displayed
using d3 graphs to transform parts of the data into a more pleasant viewing medium.

## UX 
This website is mainly for fans of the English Premier League, but the barrier to entry for my site is very low.
* Upon loading into my site, as a EPL (English Premier League) fan, I would like to see the current 20 teams making up the EPL.
    * This will be acheived by having all 20 team logos spaced out in a bootstrap grid. Clicking on these tiles will cause my webpage to display the teams name boldly across the header space of that section whilst also 
    showing preliminary data on the chosen team until the collapse is intiated.
* As a fan of team x, I would like to know my teams current position within the league.
    * This will be acheived through the data provided by the API [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/). Font awesome will also accompany this data to help add context and style to my webpage.
* As a fan of team x, I would like to know their current form.
    * This data will be linked to my d3 graphs. D3 graphs transforms mundane data into a more attractive mediums that also lead themselves to interactivity.
